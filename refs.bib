  abstract  = {We present an evolved X-band antenna design and flight prototype currently on schedule to be deployed on NASA's Space Technology 5 (ST5) spacecraft. Current methods of designing and optimizing antennas by hand are time and labor intensive, limit complexity, and require significant expertise and experience. Evolutionary design techniques can overcome these limitations by searching the design space and automatically finding effective solutions that would ordinarily not be found. The ST5 antenna was evolved to meet a challenging set of mission requirements, most notably the combination of wide beamwidth for a circularly-polarized wave and wide bandwidth. Two evolutionary algorithms were used: one used a genetic algorithm style representation that did not allow branching in the antenna arms; the second used a genetic programming style tree-structured representation that allowed branching in the antenna arms. The highest performance antennas from both algorithms were fabricated and tested, and both yielded very similar performance. Both antennas were comparable in performance to a hand-designed antenna produced by the antenna contractor for the mission, and so we consider them examples of human-competitive performance by evolutionary algorithms. As of this writing, one of our evolved antenna prototypes is undergoing flight qualification testing. If successful, the resulting antenna would represent the first evolved hardware in space, and the first deployed evolved antenna.},

abstract="Derived from the concept of self-adaptation in evolution strategies, the CMA (Covariance Matrix Adaptation) adapts the covariance matrix of a multi-variate normal search distribution. The CMA was originally designed to perform well with small populations. In this review, the argument starts out with large population sizes, reflecting recent extensions of the CMA algorithm. Commonalities and differences to continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms are analyzed. The aspects of reliability of the estimation, overall step size control, and independence from the coordinate system (invariance) become particularly important in small populations sizes. Consequently, performing the adaptation task with small populations is more intricate.",

[MGK 88], [MK 89] have proposed a genetic algorithm for the traveling salesman problem, which generates very good but not optimal solutions for traveling salesman problems with 442 and 531 cities. We have improved this approach by improving all basic components of that genetic algorithm. For our experimental investigations we used the traveling salesman problems TSP (i) with i cities for i=137, 202, 229, 318, 431, 442, 666 which were solved to optimality in [CP 80], [GH 89].",
